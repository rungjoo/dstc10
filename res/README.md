# Image pickle

image_obj.pickle is the result of image_preprocessor.py. The pre-extracted file (python3.8.8) can be downloaded from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uktgTrt6kxRsr2-WrozaJrtjXk0G2wCo/view?usp=sharing). If you are using a different python version, you may have to create it yourself.
